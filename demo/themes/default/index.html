            <h1>Hello Sailor!</h1>
            <p>Wellcome to the demo site generated with <b>static</b>.</p>
            <h2>Why another static site generator ?</h2>
            <p>
            I used to have a wordpress website. Wordpress is as powerfull as bloated and slow. It also breaks from time to time if you allow it to update automatically. So I decided "port" my personal blog as a static site. While looking for static site generators on the internet I realized almost all of them were also a bloated mess that required me to install a bunch of stuff just to replace some strings on a html files. Then I decided to spend a weekend write something that fits my needs. This is a really simple program that builds as a single command line executable and requires no additional dependencies to build or run.</p>
            <h2>Should I use it ?</h2>
            <p>Yes, but no. If you just need simple features this program gets you covered. If you need fancy frontend generation logic and don't mind installing a bunch of crap, you better not.
            </p>
            <p>
            I actually use it for my personal <a href="http://handmadegame.dev">blog</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>How to use it ?</h2>
            <p> Go on the <a hrrf="https://github.com/marciovmf/static">github page</a> and the readme.md file should give you all
            the information you need</p>

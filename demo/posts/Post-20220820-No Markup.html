If you took some time to read the source of the files inder the posts folder
you'll notice they are plain html files.

<h2>Markdown support</h2>

<p>
 I don't like the idea of only having mardown as an input for posts. Yes, it's
 probably the thing you'll use the most but sometimes you need to add extra
 stuff to a post and then you are stuck to the markdown.

<p>
My plan is to support markdown expansion between {{markdown}} {{endmarkdown}}
tags. So the generator knows that it must expand that specific block while
ignoring anything else. This makes possible for users to actually write custom
HTML code when they need to.

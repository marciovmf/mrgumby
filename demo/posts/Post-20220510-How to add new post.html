<p>
To add a new post, just add a file in the <b>posts</b> folder with the correct
naming convention.
</p>

<h3>Post file format</h3>
<p>
Post files should follow the rule <b>&lt;LAYOUT&gt;&lt;DATE&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;.html</b>.
</p>
<p> <b>&lt;LAYOUT&gt;</b> is the name of a layout file under the current theme/layout folder. </p>
<p> <b>&lt;DATE&gt;</b> is the post creation date in the format YYYYMMDD. </p>
<p> <b>&lt;TITLE&gt;</b> is the title of the post. </p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
WHile the naming convention is simple and practical, it imposes a technical
limitation because some characters are not allowed as file names. I'll probably
come up with a syntax expressing such characters so they are substituted when
generating the pages.
